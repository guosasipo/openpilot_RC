# Gamepad Key Mapping:
# Start - Toggle between manual and autonomous mode
# Right trigger - Forwards throttle
# Left trigger - Reverse throttle
# Left thumbstick - Steering input (needs to be centered properly for autonomous mode to activate)
# A - Toggle capturing images to disk
# B - Quits the script
# X - Decrement speed of car when in autonomous mode
# Y - Increment speed of car when in autonomous mode
#
# Note: If car is in autonomous mode, it will revert to manual mode if gamepad
#       is also giving driving commands. It will revert back to autonomous
#       mode once the gamepad input stops.
